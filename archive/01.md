# Time Series Analysis

## What is a Time Series?

A time series is a set of observations taken sequentially in time.

## Types of Time Series

### 1. Regular Time Series
- Observations coming in at regular intervals of time

### 2. Irregular Time Series
- We do not have observations at regular intervals of time
- **Example**: Readings from lab tests of a patient. We see an observation in the time series only when the patient heads to the clinic and carries out the lab test, and this may not happen at regular intervals.

## Data Generating Process (DGP)

DGP as the real mechanism or system in the world that creates your data over time.

## üîÅ Deterministic vs. Stochastic Processes

Time series can come from two types of processes:

### ‚úÖ Deterministic Process
- Predictable and follows exact rules
- **Example**: Radioactive decay. We can model it precisely using physics and math.

### üé≤ Stochastic Process
- Involves randomness, but often with patterns or probabilities
- **Example**: Daily weather ‚Äì it has trends and seasonality, but there's also noise and uncertainty.

### üëâ Key Insight
Most real-world time series (like stock prices, sales, weather) are stochastic because they include both predictable parts and random variation.

## üîç Why DGP Matters in Forecasting

Imagine if we knew exactly how reality worked‚Äîwe could write down the DGP in equations, plug in the inputs, and get perfect forecasts.

But that's not possible because:
- Reality is too complex
- We don't have full knowledge of all influencing factors
- Some influences are fundamentally random or hidden

So instead, we try to build a model that approximates the DGP as best we can.

**This model is like a map of the real world‚Äîuseful, but not the whole picture.**

# White Noise vs Red Noise

### ‚ö™ **White Noise**

* **Definition**: A sequence of uncorrelated random variables with:

  * Zero mean
  * Constant variance
* **Mathematically**:

  $$
  x_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
  $$
* **Properties**:

  * No memory: each point is independent of the previous.
  * Flat power spectrum (equal power at all frequencies).
  * Looks like pure static ‚Äî chaotic, unstructured.

> üîπ Think of it as the **"most random"** possible signal ‚Äî totally unpredictable and unstructured.

---

### üî¥ **Red Noise** (aka **Brownian noise** or **AR(1) process**)

* **Definition**: A time series where each value is correlated with its immediate past value.
* **Mathematically**:

  $$
  x_{j+1} = r \cdot x_j + \sqrt{1 - r^2} \cdot w_j
  $$

  * Where $r \in [-1, 1]$ is the **autocorrelation coefficient**
  * $w_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ is white noise
* **Properties**:

  * **Serial correlation**: Past values influence future ones.
  * Smoother than white noise: large changes don‚Äôt happen as rapidly.
  * More power at **low frequencies** (i.e., slowly varying patterns).
  * As $r \to 1$, it becomes very persistent (strong memory).

> üîπ Red noise **remembers its past**, and tends to "drift" over time instead of jumping randomly.

### üîß In Practice:

* Use **white noise** to simulate pure randomness or as the error term in regression models.
* Use **red noise** to simulate systems with inertia/memory, like:

  * Climate systems
  * Stock prices (to some extent)
  * Biological signals

In time series analysis, there are several **types of signals** or **time series processes**, each with unique properties related to randomness, correlation, stationarity, and predictability.



## üì¶ Common Types of Time Series Processes

### 1. **White Noise**

* **Definition**: Purely random, zero correlation.
* **Formula**: $x_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
* **Use**: Noise modeling, error terms.

---

### 2. **Red Noise** (Brownian Noise / AR(1)-like)

* **Definition**: Random process with momentum (i.e., autocorrelation).
* **Formula**: $x_t = r \cdot x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - r^2} \cdot \epsilon_t$
* **Note**: Can be seen as a type of AR(1) with a specific formulation.

---

### 3. **Pink Noise** (1/f Noise)

* **Definition**: Power spectral density decreases with frequency ‚Äî balanced between white and red noise.
* **Use**: Common in natural and biological systems.
* **Property**: Long-term memory, more structured than red noise.

---

### 4. **Blue Noise**

* **Definition**: Opposite of red noise ‚Äî higher frequencies are emphasized.
* **Property**: Negative correlation between neighboring points.
* **Use**: Graphics, dithering in image processing.

---

### 6. **Autoregressive (AR) Process**

* **Definition**: Each point depends on a linear combination of past values.
* **Formula**: $x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i x_{t-i} + \epsilon_t$

---

### 7. **Moving Average (MA) Process**

* **Definition**: Depends on past **noise/error** terms.

---

### 8. **ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average)**

* **Definition**: Combines AR and MA.
* **Formula**: $x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i x_{t-i} + \epsilon_t + \sum_{j=1}^q \theta_j \epsilon_{t-j}$

---

### 9. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**

* **Definition**: ARMA applied to **differenced data** for non-stationarity.
* **Notation**: ARIMA(p, d, q)

---

### 10. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**

* **Definition**: Extends ARIMA to model **seasonality**.
* **Notation**: SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)

---

### 11. **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**

* **Definition**: Models **time-varying volatility** in a series.
* **Use**: Finance (volatility clustering).

---

### 12. **Random Walk**

* **Definition**: Each step is a random increment of the last.
* **Formula**: $x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$
* **Property**: Non-stationary, unpredictable without mean-reversion.

---

### 13. **Periodic / Seasonal Signals**

* **Definition**: Repeating patterns over fixed intervals.
* **Examples**: Sine waves, day/night temperature cycles.

---

### 14. **Trend-Driven Signals**

* **Definition**: Long-term upward or downward movement.
* **Not a process**, but often combined with others (e.g., ARIMA + trend).

---

### 15. **Deterministic Signals**

* **Definition**: Fully predictable from a known formula (e.g., sine wave).
* **Opposite of stochastic processes**.
